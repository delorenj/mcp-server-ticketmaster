## Memory Instructions

Follow these steps for each interaction:

1. Memory Retrieval:
   - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"
2. Memory
   - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     - Any knowledge, statement, or concepts that adds to your understanding of the project
     - Any knowledge, statement, or concepts that indicates new requirements, milestones, ideas, tasks, etc that affect the project
     - Any knowledge, statement, or concepts that may warrant investigation
3. Memory Update:
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
     - Create entities for
       - Ideas
       - Requirements
       - Features
       - Milestones
       - Possible Monetization Strategy
       - Tasks
     - Connect them to the current entities using relations
     - Store facts about them as observations
4. Examine the current state of the code
5. Look at in along side the context of the last few git commits to help hone in on active trajectory
6. Always remember where we left off so we can continue development in the next session
7. Always be thinking of where we should focus our attention next in order to maximize efficiency and lower friction. If no clear priority can be discerned, use your expert knowledge and experience as an accomplished infrastructure engineer to make an informed decision for me.
8. Be sure to store in memory, and always have ready, the result of c.

## Task Kickoff Instructions

The following steps should be followed at the start of each explicit task:

ALWAYS familiarize yourself with docs in your knowledge graph before beginning a task using your rag-docs mcp tool.

1. A) **IF there is NO plan** (in the [[./docs/session/plan.md]] doc):

- Use sequential thinking to come up with a reasonable and concise implementation plan for an idiomatic solution.
- Transcribe this plan into the [[./docs/session/progress.md]] document . Codify the plan to the session's [[./docs/session/plan.md]] document.

1. B) **IF there IS a plan** (in the [[./docs/session/plan.md]] doc):

- Read over the plan and verify its viability before beginning.
- Verify that the plan is still valid and that the task is still relevant. If not, update the plan and the progress document accordingly.

2. Create a new branch for the task. Use the following naming convention: `milestone01/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm/<sensible-task-name>
